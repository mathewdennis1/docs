Phoenix is a web based IDE. It is open source, modern and  prioritises web devlopers.


## Getting started with  phoenix
 A web version of phoenix is available at [phcode.dev](https://phcode.dev/).
 We are working hard on native builds,which will be available soon.
 
 immidiatly on launching phoenix, there will be the splash screen while phoenix boots up.

## New Project window 

After Phoenix boots up, the first thing that can be seen is the New Project window.
It has two sections which are "Recent Projects" and the "New project".
